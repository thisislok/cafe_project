# ☕ Book & Brew - Python Ordering System

### 🎥 [Video Walkthrough Coming Soon]

## 📄 Description
This project is a text-based **Python ordering system** that simulates a real-world café and bookstore experience.  
Customers can order **books, coffees, and snacks**, request **product details**, or **book deliveries**. The system also supports **custom coffee creation** with dynamic ingredient pricing and applies **percentage-based discounts** through staff controls.

The modular design separates user-facing functionality and employee tools (e.g. inventory, promotions) to mirror a real POS (Point of Sale) setup.
